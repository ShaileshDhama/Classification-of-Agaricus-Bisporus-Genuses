# Classification-of-Agaricus-Bisporus-Genuses
## To classify mushrooms genuses

**Author** : SHAILESH DHAMA

Study and classify the 9 categories of most common Northern European mushrooms genuses.
                
### Dataset :

The dataset consists of a csv file: https://www.kaggle.com/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images

## Approach:

### Data processing & Exploratory Data Analysis:

    1.Import Libraries
    2.Loading and processing data
    3.Creating a model
    4.Display Results
    
           
## RESULTS :
